👋 Hi, I’m @Andyproject1 or Andy Tiu

👀 I’m interested in Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, investing and programming and all things related. As this is a huge passion and lifestyle of mines i am currently in the process of applying for a job at Caleb & Brown where i can use my knowledge and passion and apply this to create a career for myself in the industry i love.

🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and working on my skills as a Developer by devoting time out of my current job learning to program. With this being said i believe a job at the position i have applied (Junior Developer) at Caleb & Brown will not only help me advance my programming skills as an individual but also allows me to meet people who share the same passion and love for the space of Crypto and the underlying tech that it has to offer, and to use our skills to build in this space for people all over the world.

📫 Please reach me via email: andytiu123@hotmail.com

I would like to say a big thank you to Caleb & Brown and the Team for giving me this opportunity, i am extremely grateful and i hope you like the project i created.

Thank you
Andy
